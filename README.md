# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from grayscale images, leveraging the popular MNIST dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build and evaluate a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from input images.

---

## ðŸ§  Techniques Used

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction and classification  
- **Image visualization** to display inputs and misclassified samples  
- **Confusion matrix** for performance analysis  
- **Evaluation metrics** including accuracy and error analysis

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **MNIST** dataset:  
  - 60,000 training images  
  - 10,000 test images  
- Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale format

---

## âœ… Output

Given a grayscale input image, the model predicts a digit between **0â€“9**.
